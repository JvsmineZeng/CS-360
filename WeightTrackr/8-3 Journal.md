# CS-360 - Project 3 - WeightTrackr

### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
> WeightTrackr is a Mobile2App application that will soon be available on the Android store. The app helps users set a weight goal and track their progress towards that goal through daily weight entries. The app will help the frontend user to be accountable and more confident in their fitness and lifestyle journey. It will also lessen or eliminate fear of the scale. In essence, WeightTrackr is a tool to aid their health and fitness journey supplemented with diet and exercise. It is important to note that this app is only focused on weight tracking. It is not to be used to diagnose or treat a health problem or disease. Major functionalities and components of the app include the following:
> 1. Login screen
> 2. Account creation
> 3. Goal weight setting
> 4. Daily weight tracking
> 5. Store and display weight log entries
> 6. Notification to tell frontend user they reached their weight goal

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
> There were four main screens necessary for the basic functionality of this app: Login page, Registration page, Overview page, and SMS Opt-In page. Each of these met the basic requirements of the app. The Login page allows users to log into their account and access their data. The Registration page allows users to create an account if it was their first time accessing WeightTrackr. The Overview page allows users to view their daily weight logs, their progress towards their goal, and manage/add weight logs. Lastly, the SMS Opt-In page allows users to opt into text notifications if they want text updates of their weight progress. These pages utilize widgets for users’ ease of navigation and clearly outline the modules of data on the page. My UI designs are user-centric since I created a layout that encourages users to log and access their data with ease. Using tables and widgets make users feel less anxious or confused about the weight tracking process. Keeping these design choices in mind also made my designs successful.

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
> I approached it as requirements first, design second. I made sure to meet Mobile2App’s requirements for WeightTrackr, as well as user needs. This included the login, registration, overview, and SMS notifications functions and pages. Afterwards, I edited the interfaces of the pages so data could be easily input, maintained, and stored. Techniques and strategies I used included making wireframes for the interface design, and flowcharts for program logic. These templates allow me to translate client and user needs into a blueprint that I could model my code after, removing the guesswork.

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
> I made sure to save, clean, and build my code with each substantial round of edits to the program. This allowed me to keep track of the progress I made with each xml file, and their corresponding java file. I also kept a close eye on functions I would incorporate into the xml files, and the Android Studio suggestions for UI design (i.e., making widgets big enough so users can easily tap on the button without “fat fingering” another button). This process is important so you know exactly what layers or changes are incorporated in the product. It also reveals what could make or break the mobile application.

### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
> This was my first time working with Android Studio and mobile app dependencies like UserDao. Therefore most of my challenges were the learning curve with the IDE. I noticed there were significant differences in the setup instructions provided by the university versus the setup experience I had - most likely due to changes in IDE versions. However, I combated this by looking at the Android Studio guides online, and YouTube tutorials. I also refreshed my Java skills since I have not coded in Java for a while - most of my other courses were C++ heavy.

### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
>   I was able to successfully link the xml and java files together to create a working app. Seeing the xml file in code and design format helped me visualize changes with each edit I made to the code. I was also successful in determining the design and the java variables/functions used for each element.
